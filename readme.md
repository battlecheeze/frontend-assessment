Done working on exercise 1 and exercise 2.

Exercise 1 can be viewed as mindArcExercise1.html

Exercise 2 can be viewed in mindArcExercise2.html

Bonus question:

Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

Because "empty space + 'a'" is equals to NaN so the output will be baNaNa.
